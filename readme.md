## About

Backend Developer with a degree in Computer Science, currently working at Topaz.

I work primarily with Python and Flask, developing backend systems where reliability, maintainability, and security are non-negotiable. I have over three years of experience in fraud prevention, which strongly influences how I design, implement, and review software in production environments.

My focus is on clear architecture, pragmatic testing, and building systems that remain stable and understandable over time.
